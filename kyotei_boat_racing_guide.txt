# KYOTEI BOAT RACING: COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

## INTRODUCTION TO KYOTEI
Kyōtei (競艇), literally "boat racing" and now officially referred to as "BOAT RACE," is a high-speed powerboat racing sport in Japan. It was introduced in April 1952, with the first race held at Ōmura Kyōtei Stadium in Ōmura City, Nagasaki Prefecture. In April 2010, the sport was rebranded as "BOAT RACE" to promote it internationally.

Kyotei is one of Japan's four "Public Sports" (公営競技, kōei kyōgi), which are sports events where parimutuel betting is legal. The other three are horse racing, bicycle racing, and asphalt speedway motorcycle racing.

## BASIC RACE INFORMATION

### Race Format
- A Kyōtei race is conducted on man-made lakes with a 600-meter oval boat course
- Six boats race three laps around the course (total distance: 1,800 meters)
- Races are generally over in about two minutes
- A day-long racing session typically includes 12 races
- The boats race counterclockwise around the course

### Boat and Racer Identification
The boats and racers' uniforms are color-coded as follows:
- Boat 1: White
- Boat 2: Black
- Boat 3: Red
- Boat 4: Blue
- Boat 5: Yellow
- Boat 6: Green

### Race Facilities
1. **Pit**: The race starts when the docked boats leave the pit (the boats "pit-out"). The pit location varies depending on the BOAT RACE stadium.
2. **2nd-turn marker**: After they pit out, the boats race around the shortcut prevention buoy and jockey for position.
3. **Giant screen**: The jumbo-sized screen is positioned across the water from the stands, showing race information.

## UNIQUE STARTING PROCEDURE

### Flying Start System
Unlike the "standing start" used in athletic events, BOAT RACE employs the "flying start system" in which boats must pass the starting line within a designated time frame.

### From Warm-up to Start
1. The 6 boats "pit-out" all at once
2. Before crossing the starting line, they warm up by sprinting clockwise around marker 2 and the shortcut prevention buoy
3. Racers have about 100 seconds to fight for the best position before the race officially starts
4. Racers also take part in a practice race before each race begins, which can influence how spectators might bet

### Start Timing
- If a boat crosses the starting line too early before the needle on the giant clock hits 0, it's called a "flying start" (F)
- If it crosses too late after the needle hits 1, it's called a "late start" (L)
- In either case, the boat is scratched from the race and the bets on that boat are refunded

## BETTING SYSTEM
